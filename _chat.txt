[21/11/24, 11:11:41] Felix: Hey friends! If you haven’t started working out yet or your current gym isn’t what you expected, I’ve got the perfect solution for you 🏋🏼‍♀️. I’m selling my gym membership for personal reasons, and it’s a great deal!

The gym is called O2 Wellness, and it has EVERYTHING: classes, pool, spa, and all the usual equipment.

I originally paid for 6 months in advance plus the subscription fee (100 EUR), with a monthly price of 90 EUR. I’m selling the remaining 5 months for just 400 EUR 🤩—that’s only 80 EUR per month for full access! Plus, you won’t need to pay the subscription fee or the regular price.

The location is super convenient, and there’s a bus from uni that gets you there in just 10 minutes.

DM me if you’re interested! 💪https://o2cw.es/gimnasios/madrid/manuel-becerra/
[21/11/24, 11:12:23] Felix: Look no further!! I fucked up and I’m now presenting you guys with a deal that sucks 🤩

[24/12/24, 20:53:22] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: To publish your Tableau story or dashboard on Tableau Public, follow these detailed steps:

1. Create a Tableau Public Account

If you don’t already have an account, sign up on Tableau Public:

Go to Tableau Public.
Click on "Sign Up".
Fill in your details (email, name, etc.) to create a free account.
2. Open Your Tableau Project in Tableau Desktop

Make sure your dashboard or story is complete in Tableau Desktop.
Double-check that your data does not contain sensitive information (projects published on Tableau Public are visible to everyone).
3. Publish to Tableau Public

Log In:

Click on "Server" in the top menu bar of Tableau Desktop.
Select "Sign in to Tableau Public".
Log in using your Tableau Public credentials.
Publish:

Go to "Server" > "Publish to Tableau Public" > "Save to Tableau Public".
A dialog box will open asking you to confirm the name of your project.
Name Your Dashboard:

Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Accenture Strategic Dashboard").
Click "Save".
Upload:

Tableau will upload your project to Tableau Public. This process may take a few seconds or minutes depending on the size of your data.
4. Verify and Share

Once published, Tableau Public will automatically open your dashboard in a web browser.
Verify that everything is displaying correctly.
Copy the URL of your dashboard or click on "Share" to get a link that you can distribute.
5. Update Your Dashboard

If you make changes to your dashboard in Tableau Desktop and want to update it on Tableau Public:
Publish it again using the same steps. The dashboard will be updated automatically.
Important Tips

Sensitive Data: Ensure that your data does not contain confidential information, as Tableau Public makes your project visible to everyone.
Visual Design: Make sure all elements of the dashboard are well-formatted and readable before publishing.
If you encounter any specific issues during the upload process, let me know, and I’ll guide you further! 😊

[8/1/25, 23:32:43] Felix: I applied for a waiver for this week with medical proof that I have an ear infection which makes it impossible for me to fly this week (I don’t have an ear infection but the doctors note is real and you’re really prohibited to fly with an ear infection)
[8/1/25, 23:33:37] Felix: They responded to me that my case isn’t “extreme” enough and that I could take the train
[8/1/25, 23:33:43] Felix: From Antwerp to Madrid 😂
[8/1/25, 23:33:56] Emin: They’re retarded
[8/1/25, 23:34:00] Felix: Which is utterly insane

[8/1/25, 23:34:14] Emin: Tell em to pay for your train
[8/1/25, 23:34:16] Felix: But I respond
[8/1/25, 23:34:42] Felix: That I want to know the framework used to consider if a case is extreme or not
[8/1/25, 23:34:57] Felix: Which they cannot answer hahaha
[8/1/25, 23:35:14] Felix: They keep saying “each case is considered carefully and individually”
[8/1/25, 23:35:20] Emin: Yeah cause it’s Isaiah typing the email while he’s rubbing his clit to hentai
[8/1/25, 23:35:22] Felix: Okay fuckface but what does that mean hahaha

[8/1/25, 23:36:34] Emin: Don’t need AI for this

[8/1/25, 23:36:45] Emin: MMB-702 class cameras

[22/1/25, 09:25:31] Lucas Brunner: Cringe u got it wrong lads?
[22/1/25, 09:25:33] Alejandro Perez: wasnt this just about segmentation

[22/1/25, 09:26:26] Luca Adjei MBD: yes ‎<This message was edited>
[22/1/25, 09:26:26] Vandad Vafai: Nothing about Classification

[22/1/25, 09:27:55] Lucas Brunner: JM shut the fuck up
[22/1/25, 09:27:56] Emin: love how classification is literally the last unit in the course
[22/1/25, 09:28:10] Luca Adjei MBD: lovelyyyyy
[22/1/25, 09:28:45] Vandad Vafai: Should we bring it up if our grade sucked
[22/1/25, 09:28:50] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: exams are gonna be fun
[22/1/25, 09:29:46] Emin: i mean i’m gonna bring up the classification one
[22/1/25, 09:30:56] Vandad Vafai: Can someone tell Osto to shut the fuck up back there
[22/1/25, 09:32:50] Vandad Vafai: Bro this mf💀
[22/1/25, 09:33:14] Luca Adjei MBD: broke my streak this cunty ahhh question
[22/1/25, 09:33:40] Alejandro Perez: he needs to be more transparent on what goes into the test and what we have to study for it, bc pretty sure that 20 page doc didnt help for 5 out of the 7 questions
[22/1/25, 09:34:00] Emin: agreed
[22/1/25, 09:34:18] Luca Adjei MBD: shoutout cheeevin
[22/1/25, 09:34:28] Sam: This guy has fucked a 7 Q test
[22/1/25, 09:34:30] Ayush Singh: yeah remove the one question i got right, why not
[22/1/25, 09:34:32] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: this man's a joke
[22/1/25, 09:34:41] Emin: no same 😂
[22/1/25, 09:34:42] Luca Adjei MBD: loooool
[22/1/25, 09:35:09] Sam: That center back left zone was dead quiet during that debate
[22/1/25, 09:35:22] Lucas Brunner: because they got a lot wrong
[22/1/25, 09:35:38] Emin: I don’t understand when profs emphasize learning and not worrying too much about assessments but then they word the questions so poorly that you start to question your basic understanding of the topic
[22/1/25, 09:35:49] Sam: Cheers for that explanation Unc
[22/1/25, 09:36:49] Isaac Chaljub: This exam was nowhere related to actual understanding on the method
[22/1/25, 09:37:00] Lucas Brunner: agree
[22/1/25, 09:37:01] Vandad Vafai: Or any of the material the mf provided
[22/1/25, 09:37:01] Isaac Chaljub: And we didn’t use it nearly that much to be able to do it by ourselves
[22/1/25, 09:37:05] Alejandro Perez: pretty sure i ended up w negative points
[22/1/25, 09:37:13] Lucas Brunner: but tbh he will delete 1 exam
[22/1/25, 09:37:14] Vandad Vafai: I am on 0 I think
[22/1/25, 09:37:18] Lucas Brunner: so it is alright
[22/1/25, 09:37:23] Vandad Vafai: Bro fuck that
[22/1/25, 09:37:24] Lucas Brunner: and 5% is nothing
[22/1/25, 09:37:33] Vandad Vafai: You think next exam is gonna be better?
[22/1/25, 09:37:34] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: yeah but for the next ones
[22/1/25, 09:37:34] Luca Adjei MBD: hahahahaha
[22/1/25, 09:37:35] Isaac Chaljub: Yeah but once again what worries me is that we’re now gonna go into another technique
[22/1/25, 09:37:36] Lucas Brunner: really no point in putting so much energy
[22/1/25, 09:37:37] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: it has to be better
[22/1/25, 09:37:37] Lucas Brunner: in this
[22/1/25, 09:37:41] Isaac Chaljub: If we go this fast we’re gonna know nothing
[22/1/25, 09:37:52] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: yeah and at least now we know what to study
[22/1/25, 09:38:29] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: do the other class have him too?
[22/1/25, 09:38:31] Sam: Same, at least curve should be ok
[22/1/25, 09:38:34] Isaac Chaljub: No
[22/1/25, 09:39:03] Emin: i did not need jm sending me a breakdown of the difference between segmentation and classification
[22/1/25, 09:39:20] Alejandro Perez: why tf did I put a couple hours into studying his shit, shouldve just gotten drunk
[22/1/25, 09:39:21] Alejandro Perez: same result

[22/1/25, 09:41:46] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: is it gonna delete the worst one for the group ? or individually ?
[22/1/25, 09:41:50] Emin: so what i’ve learned is that I have to become a stenographer to do well in this class
[22/1/25, 09:41:53] Luca Adjei MBD: group I think

[23/1/25, 15:07:47] Vandad Vafai: mf😂😂😂😂😂
[23/1/25, 15:08:53] Emin: basic notes from this discussion:

Rule selection depends on two pillars: frequency and reliability
- Don’t use lift to find negative rules because you’ll get too many rules with a low threshold
- Confidence difference is used to select negative rules
- Confidence ratio is used for when prior confidence is low (it can also point out negative rules)
- Example of posterior confidence of 2% and prior confidence of 5% at a store
Rule won’t be picked up by lift but will be picked up by confidence ratio, important to see a product that is “stealing” sales from the prior item ‎<This message was edited>

### **LeBrunner James (The Pops Anthem)**  
*(A Rap Song for Lucas Brunner)*  

*(Intro 🎶)*  
Yeah, yeah, uh!  
You know who it is—LeBrunner James!  
Pops in the building, let's go!  

*(Verse 1 🎤)*  
Born in Serbia, raised in Zurich,  
Rolex on the wrist, man, that boy too perfect. ⌚  
Cashmere drippin’, yeah, he stay too cozy,  
Steppin' in the spot like a G, straight posy.  

Front row vibin’ with Hiro, that's the duo,  
Class ain't a lecture, it’s a comedy show. 😆  
Snappin' at the teacher like "Yo, pay attention!"  
Unc got the wisdom, always droppin' lessons.  

*(Chorus 🎶)*  
Pops in the room, better show some respect,  
Cashmere fit, Rolex flex. 💎  
Condom hat on, yeah, that's his crown,  
LeBrunner James, he don't play around!  

*(Verse 2 🎤)*  
Call him Unc, call him Pops, call him what you want,  
But when he pull up, man, he always stunt.  
Tall like a baller, they say he the GOAT,  
LeBrunner James, got the game on his coat.  

Sippin' on espresso, talkin’ big biz,  
Laughin’ with Hiro, yeah, that’s just how it is. ☕  
Smart but he slick with the jokes on the low,  
You ain't in the squad if you don’t know the code!  

*(Bridge 🎶)*  
He stay first row, but he stay laid-back,  
Knowledge in his mind, got the whole class stacked.  
Condom hat tilted, yeah, that's the sign,  
LeBrunner James, he stay on his grind.  

*(Chorus 🎶)*  
Pops in the room, better show some respect,  
Cashmere fit, Rolex flex.  
Condom hat on, yeah, that's his crown,  
LeBrunner James, he don’t play around!  

*(Outro 🎤)*  
Ayy, shoutout to Unc, shoutout to Pops,  
Drip so clean, man, he never gon' stop.  
Front row legend, y’all know the name,  
LeBrunner James, put respect on the game! 🔥

[29/1/25, 10:50:55] Felix: what was your prompt for this
[29/1/25, 10:51:09] Vandad Vafai: Make a rap song about my friend Lucas Brunner who is a Serbian guy who grew up in Zurich and wears a Rolex and only puts on cashmere clothing. He also wears this hat which is called the condom hat and since he's the oldest guy in the friend group we call him either Pops or Unc. He is also known as LeBrunner James because he's tall and his name relates to him. He sits in front row of the class with his friend called Hiro and exchanges laughter with him. He also likes snapping at the teacher to getting his/her attention.
[29/1/25, 10:51:16] Luca Adjei MBD: Lebrunner James, put respect on the game!
[29/1/25, 10:51:33] Felix: that whole verse goes kinda hard ngl
[29/1/25, 10:51:44] Felix: Pops in the room, better show some respect,  
Cashmere fit, Rolex flex.

Ayy, llegó el Tico con el flow diferente,
Lucas es la ley, siempre va pa’ enfrente.
Condom hat puesto, sí, ya tú lo sabes,
Rey del primer fila, nadie lo iguala.

Siempre en el juego, Rolex brillando, ⌚
Mente de OG, todos respetando.
Café en la mano, puro estilo fino, ☕
Zurich a Madrid, ya marcó su camino.

Clase es un chiste, pero él es la risa,
Moviendo las fichas, nadie lo pisa.
LeBrunner James, con porte elegante,
Pops es la ley, eso que no cambie.

[29/1/25, 11:30:02] Vandad Vafai: GO
[29/1/25, 11:30:17] Emin: “Professor why do we download the notebook before running it?”
[29/1/25, 11:31:00] Vandad Vafai: Bro the moment we start betting we get fucking Python scripts
[29/1/25, 11:31:25] Vandad Vafai: Throwback to the time he actually asked “How do we know if our code works?”
[29/1/25, 11:31:46] Emin: or why do we define the functions before calling them
[29/1/25, 11:31:59] Emin: that was the summit of his intelligence

‎[29/1/25, 11:33:24] Emin: ‎GIF omitted
[29/1/25, 11:33:26] Emin: real ones know^^
[29/1/25, 11:33:51] Luca Adjei MBD: fancy word for cuck
[29/1/25, 11:34:43] Emin: Rear Window (1954) explores voyeurism as both a guilty pleasure and a moral dilemma. The film positions the audience in the same role as its protagonist, Jeff, a photographer who spies on his neighbors from his apartment while recovering from an injury. Initially, his voyeurism is framed as passive curiosity, but as he becomes obsessed with a possible murder, it shifts into an ethical question—when does watching become intrusion? Hitchcock critiques the act of looking, suggesting that while voyeurism can reveal truth and even serve justice, it also comes with a cost, blurring boundaries between observation and invasion of privacy.
[29/1/25, 11:36:01] Vandad Vafai: Felix we lost our bet by 2mins
[29/1/25, 11:36:02] Vandad Vafai: fuck

(A Diss Track on Lucas Brunner)

*(Intro 🎶)*  
Yeah, yeah, uh!  
Brunner in the house? Man, clear the room!  
Big talk, small moves—get the broom!  

*(Verse 1 🎤)*  
Lucas Brunner, more like Lucas Blunder,  
Step up to the mic, watch him trip, watch him stutter. 🤡  
Think he run the game, but he ain't got the handles,  
Moves so slow, he still loading the samples.  

Fake flex Rolex, that ain't even ticking,  
Cashmere sweater? Man, that style straight missing. 💀  
Trying to stunt, but your jokes ain't hitting,  
Front row clown, class full of victims.  

*(Chorus 🎶)*  
Brunner in the room? Nah, that's just noise,  
Talks big game, but he lacking the poise.  
No respect, just collectin’ L’s,  
LeBrunner James? More like Brunner Fails. 🚮  

*(Verse 2 🎤)*  
Hairline running like he late for the bus,  
Tryna keep up, but he lost in the dust. 🏃‍♂️💨  
Condom hat tilted like his logic in class,  
Man, sit down, you ain't built to last.  

Espresso in his hand, but the shots stay weak,  
Tried to take a W, lost twice this week. ☕❌  
Hiro got jokes, but you the real clown,  
Steppin' to me? Boy, pipe it down!  

*(Bridge 🎶)*  
He first row, but he last on the list,  
Tryna act wise, but the logic got twists. 🔄  
Dollars on the wrist, but the flex ain't real,  
Brunner stay cappin’—that’s a regular meal. 🧢  

*(Chorus 🎶)*  
Brunner in the room? Nah, that's just noise,  
Talks big game, but he lacking the poise.  
No respect, just collectin’ L’s,  
LeBrunner James? More like Brunner Fails. 🚮  

*(Outro 🎤)*  
Ayy, shoutout to Brunner, but he ain't the GOAT,  
Tryna ride waves, but he sinkin' the boat. 🛶💦  
No more talkin', put respect on the name,  
But not yours, 'cause you outta the game! 🔥

[29/1/25, 12:36:54] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: say less
[29/1/25, 12:37:44] Isaac Chaljub: (Verse 1)
Yo, you 33, actin’ like you barely hit your teens,
Still stuck in '09, but life ain't a time machine.
You talk big game, like you the smartest in the place,
But your logic got more holes than the scars on your face.

(Hook)
Big man, small brain, think you run the whole town,
But you trippin’ over thoughts, got your IQ fallin’ down.
Talkin’ like a king, but your throne’s just a chair,
You a glitch in the system, how’d you make it this far?

(Verse 2)
Askin’ dumb questions like you never seen the news,
Brain workin’ half-speed, like it’s stuck on snooze.
You belittle everybody, tryna act so wise,
But your wisdom lookin’ faker than your hairline's disguise.

(Bridge)
You the type to Google “how to breathe” and take notes,
Braggin’ ‘bout your knowledge but you barely stay afloat.
Every convo’s painful, got me losin’ my mind,
Tryna school me? Bruh, stay in your lane, stay behind.

(Outro)
Donwy clown, bro, the circus called back,
Said they need their joke returned, they can’t function like that.
So take a seat, lil’ homie, let the grown-ups talk,
Before you trip over your ego and forget how to walk

[29/1/25, 12:41:43] Felix: Vandad the Fraud" (Diss Track)
(Verse 1)
Yo, Vandad, listen up, gotta drop some facts,
20 kg lifts? Bro, that's straight-up whack.
Tryna flex Romanian, but you ain’t that strong,
Legs lookin’ shaky—bro, what went wrong?

(Pre-Chorus)
You talk big game, but you ain’t got the moves,
Girls walk past like “who’s this dude?”
And Enrico’s lips? Yeah, that’s your groove,
Tryna act straight, but we all got clues.

(Chorus)
Ohhh Vandad, why you so sus?
Stuttering hard when you talk to us.
Shat your pants, man, that’s real tough,
And we don’t even think you drink that stuff!

(Verse 2)
You pull up to the gym, tryna act all mean,
But your PR’s lookin’ like a warm-up scene.
Ain’t no protein shakes, just excuses and dreams,
Little baby weights? Man, that’s obscene!

(Bridge)
Enrico's your type, yeah, we seen you close,
Whispering sweet nothings, yeah, we all know.
Beer in your hand? Man, that’s just for show,
Put it to your lips? Nah, that’s a "no."

(Outro)
Vandad the Fraud, yeah, that’s your name,
Weak in the gym, weak in the game.
Can’t pull a girl, can’t pull a plate,
Just log off, bro—it’s way too late.

🔥💀

(A Diss Track on Robert – The Fake German from Luxembourg)  

---

*(Intro 🎶)*  
Yo, yo, uh!  
Robert in the house? Man, we all know,  
Fake German vibes, Luxembourg show.  
Chueca’s prince but he flex like a king,  
Passport don’t match—man, what’s this thing?  

*(Verse 1 🎤)*  
Robert talkin’ big, like he fresh outta Berlin,  
But that accent shaky—where the hell you been? 🤔  
Luxembourg paper but no German roots,  
Bro, you a tourist, just switching your suits.  

Chueca boy strutting, rainbow parade, 🌈  
Still in the closet? Nah, that rent been paid!  
Flirting with the boys but he act all shy,  
Bro, we all know—don’t even deny!  

*(Chorus 🎶)*  
Fake German, fake flex, fake ID,  
Robert out here with identity fatigue.  
Chueca’s MVP but he play both sides,  
One foot in Berlin, one in Spanish pride! 🇪🇸🇩🇪  

*(Verse 2 🎤)*  
Says he’s from Deutschland, but he lost in translation,  
Passport Luxembourg? That’s immigration. ✈️  
Pretendin’ he Aryan, but he Balkan-built,  
Man’s got roots but they lost in the tilt.  

Tight jeans, silk shirt, walkin’ like a queen,  
Strutting through Madrid like a runway scene. 💃  
Side-eye looks but the moves stay slick,  
Boyfriend or girlfriend? Man, Robert just pick!  

*(Bridge 🎶)*  
But wait—hold up, let’s talk ‘bout his heart,  
Ain’t no boy, man, it's all ‘bout Marta! 😍  
MP on his mind, can’t let her go,  
Talks all gay, but for her? He’d switch the show!  

Texts her at midnight, begging for a chance,  
But she ghostin’ fast—boy, stay in your stance! 🚫  
Dreams of her touch, but she far away,  
Robert’s love life? Just pure cliché!  

*(Chorus 🎶)*  
Fake German, fake flex, fake ID,  
Robert out here with identity fatigue.  
Chueca’s MVP but he play both sides,  
One foot in Berlin, one in Spanish pride! 🇪🇸🇩🇪  

*(Outro 🎤)*  
Ay, shoutout to Rob, but stop with the cap,  
Passport says one thing, but bro, that’s a trap. 🚫  
Chueca’s finest? Man, just own your fate,  
And Marta? Bro, she left the gate! 🔥

### **(Intro) 🎤**  
Juan Martin? More like Juan Mistake,  
Wife look fake, whole life misplaced.  
Speaks in class? Bro, stop that now,  
Every time he talk, whole room shut down. 🤡  

---

### **(Verse 1) 🔥**  
No drip, no style, bro shops on Temu,  
Think he got sauce? That’s plain tofu.  
Talking that nonsense, brain on low fuel,  
We just sit back like, "Damn, who schooled you?" 💀  

Tryna flex hard, but your fit says "cheap,"  
Whole outfit cost less than my Uber seat. 🚗💨  
Say you got racks? Nah, say it ain't so,  
Bro’s net worth lower than my phone on low batt mode. 📉  

---

### **(Chorus) 🎶**  
Martin be talking? Nah, Martin be tweaking,  
Every time he speaks, whole class start sleeping. 😴  
Tryna sound smart? That plan ain’t clicking,  
Your girl ain't real, just AI-assisted. 🤖  

---

### **(Verse 2) 🎤**  
Wife in the pics, but we know that’s stock,  
Whole relationship built like a bot.  
Say you in love, but bro, let’s be real,  
She got "Google Translate" saved on speed dial. 📞😂  

Fit so trash, Temu done scammed you,  
Whole style weak, looking like canned food. 🥫  
New chain? Nah, that’s rust on your neck,  
Juan in the club? Nah, Juan on the bench.  

---

### **(Bridge) 💥**  
Ayy, no motion, no cash, no vision, no plan,  
Bro be lost like a tourist in Japan.  
Standing there dumb, like a mannequin stiff,  
Tryna go bar for bar? Bro, don’t even trip. 🚫🎤  

---

### **(Outro) 🎤🔥**  
Juan Martin, take a seat, get schooled,  
Say one more word, you might get booed.  
This here fire, but you just the ash,  
No motion, no progress – dash! 🏃‍♂️💨

[29/1/25, 12:53:30] Robert Koegel: “Louis’s Double Life” 🎤🔥

(Intro)
Yo, Louis, time to pull back the curtain,
Livin’ two lives, but the truth’s uncertain.
From Côte d’Ivoire to Madrid’s gay scene,
Tell me, Louis, which one’s the real dream?

(Verse 1)
Ivory Coast to France, Canada, too,
But in Chueca at night, you’re someone new.
Why you frontin’ like your world ain’t split?
Hidin’ in the nightlife, but you still ain’t legit.

Yeah, you got that alibi girl on the side,
But we know where you roam when it’s dark outside.
Pretendin’ you straight when the sun hits the sky,
But after hours, we all know it’s a lie.

(Chorus)
Double life Louis, what you tryna hide?
Out in Chueca, but you duckin’ on the side.
Dancin’ in the clubs, living out your dream,
But Geneva calls, and you change the whole scene.
Who you foolin’, bro? We know the routine,
Two worlds, one Louis—if you know what I mean.

(Verse 2)
Mister “I’m straight,” but we all see the play,
Whispers in Chueca, “Yeah, he stays ‘til the day.”
You got the moves, but the truth’s on the low,
Tell your alibi girl, “Sorry, I got a show.”

Louis, Louis, your life’s in a twist,
Worried all day ’bout the messages missed.
You got them braids, pearls shining so bright,
But who’s really stroking ’em in the dead of the night?

(Bridge)
You’re known in the clubs, but the whispers don’t lie,
Chueca knows Louis—ain’t no “straight guy.”
You act all cool, like it’s just a phase,
But we see you, man, living in two different ways.

(Outro)
Louis, Louis, how long can this last?
Secrets at night, while your girl stays masked.
Double life, double stress, double lies—
One day it’ll crumble, don’t act surprise
[29/1/25, 12:54:25] Luca Adjei MBD: Louis, Louis, your life’s in a twist,
Worried all day ’bout the messages missed.
You got them braids, pearls shining so bright,
But who’s really stroking ’em in the dead of the night?
[29/1/25, 12:54:27] Luca Adjei MBD: Yeooooooooo
[29/1/25, 12:54:28] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: ou got them braids, pearls shining so bright,
But who’s really stroking ’em in the dead of the night?
[29/1/25, 12:54:30] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: shiiii
[29/1/25, 12:54:31] Luca Adjei MBD: hahahahahahaha
[29/1/25, 12:55:01] Alejandro Perez: Theres a gay-demic going on these days
[29/1/25, 12:55:04] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: good job good job

Let me know if you want me to tweak any lines or make it even spicier. 😈  

---

### **"BBG is Lame" (The Blanca Roast Anthem)**  
*(To the tune of a playful diss track, think old-school rap battle vibes!)*  

**[Verse 1]**  
Yo, gather ‘round, let me tell you a tale,  
‘Bout a girl named Blanca, her life's a big fail.  
Calls herself BBG but ain't nobody cares,  
‘Cause being that lame just ain't really rare.  

**[Verse 2]**  
Teacher’s pet, yeah, she’s top of the class,  
Always up front, tryna kiss some ass.  
After every lecture, laptop in hand,  
Acting like a scholar—nah, we all can’t stand!  

**[Chorus]**  
BBG so lame, it’s a certified fact,  
She lost to Isaac—bruh, she can’t fight back.  
Got a nose so long, call her a Toucan,  
Thought she had game, but Tomas said “Nah, man.”  

**[Verse 3]**  
Walkin’ ‘round campus with that awkward stance,  
Boyfriend so weak, he don’t stand a chance.  
No friends, no clout, got no real crew,  
Two losers together—yeah, that’s old news.  

**[Bridge]**  
Thought she was poppin’, thought she was queen,  
Turns out she’s just desperate and real obscene.  
Tryna flex hard, but we all see through,  
BBG, sit down—this roast’s for you!  

**[Chorus Repeat]**  
BBG so lame, it’s a certified fact,  
She lost to Isaac—bruh, she can’t fight back.  
Got a nose so long, call her a Toucan,  
Thought she had game, but Tomas said “Nah, man.”  

**[Outro]**  
So Blanca, my friend, this ain't outta hate,  
It’s just a roast ‘cause your life’s second-rate.  
But don’t take it too hard, don’t be so blue,  
Even Toucans gotta find their crew.  

🎤 *Mic drop*

Please write me a roast song for this friend I have who her name is Blanca. Her short name is BBG but no one calls her that cause she is hella lame. She is the teacher's pet and tries to kiss the teacher's ass every time after the class ends by walking up to them with her dogdy laptop. She has a massive nose and we call her a Tucan for that and has beef with Isaac that she lost. She has this cuck boyfriend who is also a loser who has no friends and she also got rejected by this guy called Tomas Valbuena

[29/1/25, 13:05:57] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: ### **Luca the Impostor (AC Milan’s Loudest Fan)**  
(A Diss Track on Luca – The Fake African DJ from Germany)  

---

*(Intro 🎶)*  
Yo, yo, uh!  
Luca in the chat, yeah, he typing away,  
Talks real big but got nothing to say.  
Fake African, fake Russian, fake rep,  
Ghana in his blood? Man, that’s just a flex.  

*(Verse 1 🎤)*  
Half Ghana, half Russia—man, pick a side,  
But lived in Germany? Bro, why you lie? 🤥  
Talkin’ like Wakanda but ain’t seen the sun,  
Only thing African ‘bout you is that "my dad’s the one!"  

AC Milan beanie, coverin’ the truth,  
What’s under there, bro? That hairline aloof? 🧢  
Hiding from the facts, hiding from the light,  
Beanie stay on ‘cause the fade ain't right!  

*(Chorus 🎶)*  
Fake African, fake flex, fake life,  
Luca talk big, but he duck in real fights.  
AC Milan, yeah, that’s his disguise,  
Smoke in his lungs, but the truth in his eyes. 👀  

*(Verse 2 🎤)*  
Always in the chat, yap-yap all day,  
But when class start? Man, he M.I.A. 📚🚫  
Professor call his name, bro, just stay ghost,  
Never passed a quiz, but he braggin' the most.  

DJ life, but the beats don’t drop,  
Smoke in the air, man, lungs might pop! 🚬💨  
Says he got girls, but we know it’s a show,  
Fake dating, fake flirting—bro, just let go!  

*(Bridge 🎶)*  
Trips to Milano, tryna flex on the ‘Gram,  
But that beanie stay tight like a loyalty scam. 🤡  
Acting all tough, but inside he confused,  
Luca, my boy, just tell us the news! 🌈  

*(Chorus 🎶)*  
Fake African, fake flex, fake life,  
Luca talk big, but he duck in real fights.  
AC Milan, yeah, that’s his disguise,  
Smoke in his lungs, but the truth in his eyes. 👀  

*(Outro 🎤)*  
Shoutout to Luca, the king of cap,  
DJ or student? Man, pick up a map! 🗺️  
AC Milan, but the squad don’t know,  
Bro, drop the act—it’s time to show! 🔥

This one’s got **bars**—hope he can take the heat! 😆  

---

### **"Emin the Lame" (The Boston Escape Anthem)**  
*(Think of this as a savage diss track—old-school battle rap vibes!)*  

**[Verse 1]**  
Yo, let’s talk ‘bout Emin, this story’s a joke,  
Ran away to Boston, but still he stay broke.  
Daddy’s a dentist, but the money ain't there,  
Bruh, how your fam got drills but still in despair?  

**[Verse 2]**  
Got a “girlfriend” back home? We all know that’s fake,  
Man out here simpin’ for pixels on a screen like a snake.  
Always fartin’ loud, yo, clear the room,  
Last time he tried—💩💨 had a real-life boom!  

**[Chorus]**  
Emin so weak, he allergic to nuts,  
Manuel got racks, yeah, that’s what cuts.  
Always talkin’ smack but can’t back it up,  
Bro jealous as hell, tryna act tough!  

**[Verse 3]**  
Arguin’ with Manuel? Bruh, that’s real sad,  
Old money Dominican—he flexin’ that bag.  
Meanwhile, you stressin’, tryna compare,  
But you got no pesos, just hot fart air!  

**[Bridge]**  
Boston ain't saving you, you still a clown,  
Peanut-allergic, bro can't be around.  
Weak immune system, weak in the mind,  
Even your fake girl left you behind!  

**[Chorus Repeat]**  
Emin so weak, he allergic to nuts,  
Manuel got racks, yeah, that’s what cuts.  
Always talkin’ smack but can’t back it up,  
Bro jealous as hell, tryna act tough!  

**[Outro]**  
Emin my guy, this ain't even that mean,  
But you makin’ it too easy—bro, fix your routine!  
Boston or not, you still the same,  
Forever a loser, forever so lame.  

🎤 *Mic drop* 🚀

Bar taps open, yeah, we never quit.
Warehouse nights, ain't no rules in sight,
By the time we hit Fitz, it’s a rockstar life!

Shirt half-open, beer in my hand,

Big Robi chuggin', Joaqo too,
Isaac in the corner talkin’ reckless, dude!

Diddy got the wrist, champagne in his hands!

Brotherhood bond, that’s just how we win.
Loyal to the squad, never switch, never quit,

[30/1/25, 12:26:25] Vandad Vafai: [Verse 1]
Ayo, it's Felix, straight outta Belgium town, 🇧🇪
Bottle in his hand, man, he never puts it down! 🍾
Livin’ on the streets, call it five-star pavement, 🏚️
Skipped so many classes, he don't know the placement! 🎓🚫

Fake cashmere, rockin’ that blue, 🧶💙
Sweater so stiff, man, it barely moves! 🥶
Goosens? Nah, they call you The Goose, 🦢
Waddlin’ around, always sippin’ that juice! 🍺

[Chorus]
Felix, Felix, bro, you a mess, 🤦‍♂️
Therapy calls, better book that sesh! 📅🛋️
Said they shot you? Man, stop that stunt— 💥
It was just a kid with a water gun! 💦🔫

[Verse 2]
Every night drunk, every day the same, 🍷
Wake up in an alley, forgettin’ your name! 😵‍💫
Told us you ballin’, livin’ so fast, 🏎️
But you can’t even afford a real sweater, bruh, that’s sad! 😂

We all tryna help, but you just won't listen, 🙉
Beer in your veins, man, your liver gone missin’! 🫀💀
Time to wake up, put the bottle down, ⏳
Or The Goose finna drown in his own hometown! 🦢🌊

[Outro]
So Felix, my guy, take this as a sign, ✍️
Before your whole life turns into a wine! 🍇🍾
Now drink some water, clean up your act, 🚰
Or next time we roast, we ain’t holdin’ back! 🔥😂

🔥 Stay hydrated, Goose! 🔥

[30/1/25, 15:25:57] Emin: everyone has a different training dataset so it’ll be different
[30/1/25, 15:26:12] Emin: i think? might be wrong lol
[30/1/25, 15:26:15] Lucas Brunner: no
[30/1/25, 15:26:21] Lucas Brunner: we all have the same randomstate
[30/1/25, 15:26:26] Lucas Brunner: or not?
[30/1/25, 15:26:38] Luca Adjei MBD: dont think so
‎[30/1/25, 15:26:40] Lucas Brunner: ‎image omitted
[30/1/25, 15:26:57] Lucas Brunner: Am I gay, stupid or dumb?

[30/1/25, 15:27:19] Luca Adjei MBD: yeh same

[30/1/25, 15:27:38] Lucas Brunner: krazy
[30/1/25, 15:27:40] Isaac Chaljub: It's because we didn't specify a seed
[30/1/25, 15:27:41] Alejandro Perez: think thats how it works too
[30/1/25, 15:28:03] Isaac Chaljub: So there's no repetition on results
‎[30/1/25, 15:28:28] Lucas Brunner: ‎image omitted
[30/1/25, 15:28:31] Alejandro Perez: random_state = 69 is the move
[30/1/25, 15:28:32] Lucas Brunner: but we set it
[30/1/25, 15:28:50] Lucas Brunner: maybe I should just stop thinking
[30/1/25, 15:29:25] Emin: we don’t have random state set in the second train_test_split
[30/1/25, 15:29:29] Emin: probably where it differs
[30/1/25, 15:29:34] Lucas Brunner: ahh right
[30/1/25, 15:29:38] Lucas Brunner: that is also what I thought
[30/1/25, 15:29:41] Felix: think you should put your hat back on

[30/1/25, 15:31:12] Felix: not in a position to talk shit at all

[3/2/25, 17:16:05] Felix: Don’t you?
[3/2/25, 17:16:20] Isaac Chaljub: Nah, hating someone like that is wasted energy
[3/2/25, 17:17:21] Isaac Chaljub: I feel he’s exactly the type pf person I don’t want to have any contact with, especially after the first weeks when he tried to put me down every chance he had

[3/2/25, 17:36:45] Luca Adjei MBD: Is that a sick joke?
[3/2/25, 17:36:49] Luca Adjei MBD: 😹😹😹
[3/2/25, 17:37:08] Isaac Chaljub: Yeah all the beef from my side started because the first few weeks he’d try to stand out with Blanca, Ana or any other person we frequented by trying to make me look bad, make fun of me, or try to correct me every time I asked a question during class
[3/2/25, 17:37:33] Luca Adjei MBD: No way
[3/2/25, 17:37:44] Isaac Chaljub: So after a while of dealing with that shit I got fed up and simply started ignoring him
[3/2/25, 17:37:45] Luca Adjei MBD: Did not know that
[3/2/25, 17:37:54] Luca Adjei MBD: That’s so foul
[3/2/25, 17:38:03] Isaac Chaljub: And then the group projects became impossible because he wanted to change every little thing I proposed or did
[3/2/25, 17:38:16] Isaac Chaljub: That’s the TLDR hahaha
[3/2/25, 17:38:49] Luca Adjei MBD: He’s actually such a pleb
[3/2/25, 17:39:59] Emin: Pleb is a compliment to that piece of shit
[3/2/25, 17:40:17] Luca Adjei MBD: I didn’t know he was a bad person
[3/2/25, 17:40:23] Luca Adjei MBD: Thought he was just retarded
[3/2/25, 17:41:36] Alejandro Perez: Only time i spoke to him and i was hungover he looked at me and basically expressed “yeah i would never stoop to ur level”
[3/2/25, 17:41:52] Alejandro Perez: Like damn bro im just tryna have some fun in my twenties out here
[3/2/25, 17:42:10] Vandad Vafai: Bro can only have fun at the special ed camp

IE Campus documents area.

[4/2/25, 16:34:12] Alejandro Perez: yea 1 0
[4/2/25, 16:34:21] Alejandro Perez: but i was brain dead at the end, so cant remember
[4/2/25, 16:34:32] Isaac Chaljub: you standardize to reduce effect of difference of units
[4/2/25, 16:34:39] Alejandro Perez: yeah u might be right then
[4/2/25, 16:34:49] Emin: ok yeah that was my logic but still the other answers were so poorly worded so idk
[4/2/25, 16:34:52] Alejandro Perez: but his wording is tricky
[4/2/25, 16:35:25] Isaac Chaljub: Not sure about the question, but in real life you standardize to avoid having some variables weighting more than others just because their scale is bigger** ‎<This message was edited>

[4/2/25, 20:05:37] Isaac Chaljub: I’m fed up with this
[4/2/25, 20:05:53] Emin: It’s not even about the grade at this point, it’s so counter productive to learning
[4/2/25, 20:05:53] Isaac Chaljub: I haven’t learned anything + have only been getting bad grades
[4/2/25, 20:05:55] Isaac Chaljub: Fuck this
[4/2/25, 20:05:59] Isaac Chaljub: Exactly
[4/2/25, 20:07:17] Vandad Vafai: I have been learning shit but I actually have been ass at these quizzes
[4/2/25, 20:07:48] Vandad Vafai: Like if mf actually asks what he's teaching us I can explain or at least do a quiz with a +70 score
[4/2/25, 20:08:10] Vandad Vafai: But at this points it's not about what he teaches
[4/2/25, 20:08:20] Vandad Vafai: It's that he just doesn't want us to have a good grade
[4/2/25, 20:08:32] Isaac Chaljub: Listen I’m gonna be super arrogant here, but I know this shit almost perfectly in a real word application cause I’ve done it
[4/2/25, 20:08:40] Isaac Chaljub: What he is evaluating makes zero sense
[4/2/25, 20:09:00] Vandad Vafai: Also who the fuck needs this much theory
[4/2/25, 20:09:15] Isaac Chaljub: Last quiz for example, when the fuck am I gonna get an association analysis that doesn’t give me the support
[4/2/25, 20:09:19] Isaac Chaljub: That is stupid
[4/2/25, 20:09:23] Vandad Vafai: Mf barely talked about the usage of ML's real world applications
[4/2/25, 20:09:40] Vandad Vafai: I did this in my undergrad and we were only looking at real world examples
[4/2/25, 20:10:19] Vandad Vafai: We completely understood how the cluster algorithms would work in Netflix cause we did simulations and shit
[4/2/25, 20:11:00] Vandad Vafai: This mf talking about linear regression and I guarantee you all the OP coders who ik none of them even know what that means😂

[4/2/25, 20:15:09] Vandad Vafai: Watch him tell you to pipe down
[4/2/25, 20:15:20] Vandad Vafai: He did it to Ale and Brunner last time
[4/2/25, 20:15:28] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: I still can’t believe this. He mentioned stepwise once between ALL the documents. The word count for stepwise in everything he’s given us, is 1😭
[4/2/25, 20:15:42] Alejandro Perez: U remember how he said last time email me and ill provide extra info

[4/2/25, 20:18:10] Emin: P value isn’t the test that’s why it’s wrong
[4/2/25, 20:18:15] Emin: Fuck off

[4/2/25, 20:43:25] Luca Adjei MBD: Spineless fucks would never do it if they’d be up
[4/2/25, 20:44:25] Emin: I don’t think Blanca would say anything which means her clan might stay quiet
[4/2/25, 20:44:32] Vandad Vafai: No no

[11/2/25, 16:50:28] Vandad Vafai: You either don’t know the meaning of the word glazing or what I do w the stories
[11/2/25, 16:50:41] Lucas Brunner: i think necessarily the problem with this class was that the timeline was way to short
[11/2/25, 16:50:45] Lucas Brunner: with his teaching style

[11/2/25, 16:51:57] Sam: PabloGPT needs to cool it with the AI questions

[11/2/25, 16:54:48] Lucas Brunner: are*
[11/2/25, 16:54:56] Emin: option b is written horribly and the statement is technically true
[11/2/25, 16:55:18] Robert Koegel: fair enough
[11/2/25, 16:56:20] Felix: This is also a semantics class, should be in the syllabus somewhere
[11/2/25, 16:56:32] Joaquin Miño: true
[11/2/25, 16:56:38] Robert Koegel: that could lead to confusion, thank you Emin
[11/2/25, 16:56:41] Emin: this is wild man
[11/2/25, 16:57:01] Emin: led him there and he patted himself on the back, had a wank in front of the class, and continued
[11/2/25, 16:57:25] Felix: “lexical semantics applied to machine learning” is the actual name of this course
[11/2/25, 16:59:32] Felix: I think I confused you Emin, keep in mind that is not at all what I try to do here
[11/2/25, 16:59:45] Vandad Vafai: Watch JM ask “why” at the end of his explanation
[11/2/25, 17:00:22] Vandad Vafai: TV in for JM
[11/2/25, 17:00:28] Emin: sorry boys i’m actually livid, he’s straight up changing his answers in a span of five minutes
[11/2/25, 17:00:43] Robert Koegel: all good, you are confused Emin
[11/2/25, 17:00:52] Lucas Brunner: 😂😂😂
[11/2/25, 17:00:58] Sam: He does not mean to confuse you
[11/2/25, 17:01:23] Luca Adjei MBD: bro is rambling on and on
[11/2/25, 17:01:26] Sam: If the review session for a 7 minute test takes an hour then there has to be a problem
[11/2/25, 17:01:26] Felix: This is all so you learn better and more
[11/2/25, 17:01:55] Sam: How are we only on Q5 💀

[11/2/25, 17:09:31] Luca Adjei MBD: mf think he got executive power
[11/2/25, 17:09:52] Isaac Chaljub: Valbuena also asked me
[11/2/25, 17:09:58] Sam: I always liked this Alvaro guy
[11/2/25, 17:09:59] Isaac Chaljub: I honestly don't give a fuck right now

[11/2/25, 17:12:48] Isaac Chaljub: People don’t seem to understand how moving shit works
[11/2/25, 17:12:51] Vandad Vafai: You gonna really stay in this group?
[11/2/25, 17:12:53] Emin: 2 weeks is far too much
[11/2/25, 17:13:14] Felix: on the other hand it wouldn’t really matter I’m not going to do anything for it besides reading it once for tomorrow
[11/2/25, 17:13:51] Joaquin Miño: And that will be true also if it moved two weeks from now
[11/2/25, 17:13:55] Sam: Once again why are we even getting a say in this, can’t just move deadlines around in real life if we feel too busy
[11/2/25, 17:14:00] Felix: So either reading it once now or in 2weeks don’t really make the difference I guess?
[11/2/25, 17:14:10] Luca Adjei MBD: Mfs (and I was them) be thinking way too short term
[11/2/25, 17:14:18] Emin: preachhhhh
[11/2/25, 17:14:18] Isaac Chaljub: Yeah I don’t understand that
[11/2/25, 17:14:24] Isaac Chaljub: Hate when professors get on that shit
[11/2/25, 17:14:30] Luca Adjei MBD: yup
[11/2/25, 17:15:00] Vandad Vafai: Shitting on Hiroshi never felt this good
[11/2/25, 17:15:05] Emin: this quiz is not that deep, we haven’t covered a lot of material
[11/2/25, 17:15:10] Luca Adjei MBD: also the thing is
[11/2/25, 17:15:16] Luca Adjei MBD: people are scared of ML
[11/2/25, 17:15:17] Luca Adjei MBD: big time
[11/2/25, 17:15:26] Luca Adjei MBD: hence want to maximise their study hours
[11/2/25, 17:16:03] Emin: I mean, sounds "easy" but if the operations quiz is like machine learning quizzes?
[11/2/25, 17:16:08] Sam: Think you accidentally shat on Pablo hahah

[11/2/25, 23:37:13] Robert Koegel: rule support refers to the % of instances to total transactions. Total Transactions = 2000. So instances is where A,B were purchased. And confidence is how often C was purchased while A,B were purchased, e.g. 40% of 200 —> 80
[11/2/25, 23:38:00] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: thanks robby🙌🏻

[11/2/25, 23:44:56] Robert Koegel: both refer to A, B, C being purchased but either compared to total transactions or instances where A,B appear

[12/2/25, 11:15:29] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: I’m fine bro
[12/2/25, 11:15:32] Lucas Brunner: was segmentation right?
[12/2/25, 11:15:40] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: i put that
[12/2/25, 11:15:42] Felix: aiii Lucas
[12/2/25, 11:15:44] Vandad Vafai: Apparently it was Classification
[12/2/25, 11:15:46] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: don’t want any of his stuttering near me
[12/2/25, 11:15:46] Felix: totally wrong...
[12/2/25, 11:15:47] Lucas Brunner: fuck
[12/2/25, 11:15:52] Lucas Brunner: I was not sure
[12/2/25, 11:15:54] Sam: Yous and Vandad were playing duos earlier
[12/2/25, 11:15:57] Vandad Vafai: I chose Segmentation as well
[12/2/25, 11:16:01] Lucas Brunner: classification or segmentation
[12/2/25, 11:16:08] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: Yuuuuuuuuur
[12/2/25, 11:16:10] Vandad Vafai: But Emin’s logic made more sense
[12/2/25, 11:16:14] Robert Koegel: i put classification
[12/2/25, 11:16:15] Felix: nah fam
[12/2/25, 11:16:18] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: I’m 🆙
[12/2/25, 11:16:19] Isaac Chaljub: It was classification
[12/2/25, 11:16:22] Felix: I put segm
[12/2/25, 11:16:28] Isaac Chaljub: Because you had defined classes previously
[12/2/25, 11:16:31] Luca Adjei MBD: was in the same situation
[12/2/25, 11:16:44] Isaac Chaljub: Segmentation doesn’t assign groups, just creates them
[12/2/25, 11:16:44] Lucas Brunner: my exam is cooked
[12/2/25, 11:16:44] Luca Adjei MBD: fuckit
[12/2/25, 11:16:46] Lucas Brunner: hhaahahaha
[12/2/25, 11:16:52] Vandad Vafai: wait
[12/2/25, 11:16:54] Alejandro Perez: it was segmentation
[12/2/25, 11:16:55] Vandad Vafai: Hear ale out
[12/2/25, 11:16:57] Lucas Brunner: yes I thought the samebut I was not sure
[12/2/25, 11:17:00] Luca Adjei MBD: calm ur tits
[12/2/25, 11:17:01] Alejandro Perez: i asked if the categories were predefined and he said no
[12/2/25, 11:17:07] Vandad Vafai: YURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[12/2/25, 11:17:14] Isaac Chaljub: Hahaha fucking Alvaro
[12/2/25, 11:17:21] Alejandro Perez: u got alvaro'd?
[12/2/25, 11:17:28] Felix: professor didn’t say this out loud but he did shake his balls a little during that class so we should’ve known
[12/2/25, 11:17:30] Isaac Chaljub: I guess
[12/2/25, 11:17:46] Sam: I think it has to be classification no? How can he predefine categories and say they’re not predefined
[12/2/25, 11:17:58] Sam: What a clown
[12/2/25, 11:18:23] Alejandro Perez: well if its classification then he lied str8 to my face
[12/2/25, 11:18:24] Vandad Vafai: Very weird
[12/2/25, 11:18:26] Alejandro Perez: which would not be cool
[12/2/25, 11:18:35] Luca Adjei MBD: Lucas up again
[12/2/25, 11:18:39] Vandad Vafai: I mean this logic completely applies
[12/2/25, 11:18:42] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: its like dbscan handling large datasets, on every website they say it cant but alvaro said they do
[12/2/25, 11:18:43] Alejandro Perez: ill tweak
[12/2/25, 11:18:54] Alejandro Perez: if its class
[12/2/25, 11:19:03] Vandad Vafai: But I chose Segmentation cause I had the same thought process as Ale, Lucas, etc
[12/2/25, 11:19:07] Felix: He is a clown, i put “dbscan works for large datasets” as correct bc I know according to him it is but if you look that up anywhere it says otherwise
[12/2/25, 11:19:12] Sam: Blud makes up his own rules
[12/2/25, 11:19:18] Isaac Chaljub: Got Alvaro’d?
‎[12/2/25, 11:19:22] Robert Koegel: ‎image omitted
[12/2/25, 11:19:40] Alejandro Perez: i guess we'll see
[12/2/25, 11:19:44] Alejandro Perez: he should delete that question tbh
[12/2/25, 11:19:49] Isaac Chaljub: I went with this because I remember him saying it in one class
[12/2/25, 11:20:10] Isaac Chaljub: There it is
[12/2/25, 11:20:10] Luca Adjei MBD: ooooffff
[12/2/25, 11:20:11] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: at this point the test is on him
[12/2/25, 11:20:17] Sam: Hahaha if it’s segmentation then he lied in the question
[12/2/25, 11:20:17] Felix: exactly, kind of fucked to deliberately answer the wrong answer because you know it’s what he thinks
[12/2/25, 11:20:46] Vandad Vafai: Lets email him?
[12/2/25, 11:20:52] Alejandro Perez: not really bc u can label segmentation groups
[12/2/25, 11:20:55] Alejandro Perez: he just didnt specify
[12/2/25, 11:21:04] Lucas Brunner: it has to be classification
[12/2/25, 11:21:07] Sam: But you label them afterwards
[12/2/25, 11:21:07] Alejandro Perez: poorly worded
[12/2/25, 11:21:20] Luca Adjei MBD: yes but given what he said to ale it cant be too
[12/2/25, 11:21:28] Alejandro Perez: yeah i asked if it was labeled and he said e.g. gold buys a lot of products
[12/2/25, 11:21:31] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: I think the question makes more sense as « predefined », but if he told Ale it’s not the case then it’s fucked
[12/2/25, 11:21:40] Alejandro Perez: so behind that rationale u find the groups that buy a lot then assign them as gold
[12/2/25, 11:21:54] Vandad Vafai: But what was the question exactly
[12/2/25, 11:22:01] Luca Adjei MBD: he prolly lied to ale
[12/2/25, 11:22:07] Sam: Ohh right ok that’s such a poorly worded question then hahah
[12/2/25, 11:22:13] Luca Adjei MBD: or he just worded the question very poorly
[12/2/25, 11:22:21] Alejandro Perez: ill throw hands if thats the case
[12/2/25, 11:22:28] Luca Adjei MBD: but ale has the right to get the question removed
[12/2/25, 11:22:29] Alejandro Perez: either way if im right, he should eliminate it
[12/2/25, 11:22:34] Luca Adjei MBD: in either case
[12/2/25, 11:22:54] Emin: i put classification cause he used gold/silver/bronze customer groups as an example when explaining it to me once
[12/2/25, 11:23:01] Emin: but that's fucked if he told you otherwise
[12/2/25, 11:23:03] Lucas Brunner: ale write an email pls
[12/2/25, 11:23:12] Alejandro Perez: so basically he told us all different things lmao
[12/2/25, 11:23:14] Luca Adjei MBD: jetzt
[12/2/25, 11:23:14] Vandad Vafai: Did he say how do we categorize them
[12/2/25, 11:23:19] Vandad Vafai: Or how do we assign them
[12/2/25, 11:23:22] Alejandro Perez: que
[12/2/25, 11:23:26] Alejandro Perez: yeah ill write to him
[12/2/25, 11:23:27] Lucas Brunner: it is classification for sur
[12/2/25, 11:23:29] Luca Adjei MBD: now
[12/2/25, 11:23:29] Lucas Brunner: sure*
[12/2/25, 11:23:29] Alejandro Perez: just to have the proof
[12/2/25, 11:23:33] Vandad Vafai: Cause these would mean two different things
[12/2/25, 11:23:53] Felix: he has to twist himself in so many ways to defend what he said he can’t keep up with all of his explanations ‎<This message was edited>
[12/2/25, 11:24:00] Emin: not really, we would just have some sort of metric that we would use to define the groups
[12/2/25, 11:24:38] Vandad Vafai: I mean I don't remember but if it is "defining groups" then it should be segmentation no?
[12/2/25, 11:24:39] Felix: this guy is a pathological liar
[12/2/25, 11:24:57] Vandad Vafai: But if we're choosing them or ASSIGNING them to a group then ofc it's classification
[12/2/25, 11:25:25] Vandad Vafai: See this should not be a problem cause everyone here understands what's going on and the mf is literally trying to fuck us over with his stupid wording
[12/2/25, 11:28:47] Lucas Brunner: I dont care about my grade
[12/2/25, 11:28:49] Lucas Brunner: srsly

[19/2/25, 15:34:08] Ayush Singh: The red and his horrendous performance might be the reason people looked up some dirt on him
[19/2/25, 15:34:09] Vandad Vafai: Every call in favor for them is "a humane mistake"
[19/2/25, 15:34:19] Vandad Vafai: "They are only human after all"

[19/2/25, 15:38:43] Sam: ‘The Bird Analysis’ keep in mind we are analysing a superstore dataset
[19/2/25, 15:38:45] Ayush Singh: Not for that, for the level of refreeing in general needs to change. They are horrible

[27/2/25, 17:35:41] Vandad Vafai: And Jorge Hiroshi
[27/2/25, 17:35:45] Lucas Brunner: I think it looks like this because it is on the AR1 model
[27/2/25, 17:35:59] Emin: wait lowkey @34652615245 can you ask him
[27/2/25, 17:36:22] Lucas Brunner: Yes, exactly! Without the AR(1) structure, the autocorrelation function (ACF) would decay much faster, often dropping to zero almost immediately. Here’s why:
[27/2/25, 17:36:22] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: i read that the only condition for the ar1 model to be considered stationary is to have ϕ∣<1
[27/2/25, 17:36:49] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: i feel bad if i ask this now while hes talking about smth else lmao
[27/2/25, 17:36:58] Lucas Brunner: ask him after the class
[27/2/25, 17:37:14] Emin: eh he’s a chiller he won’t care
[27/2/25, 17:37:28] Lucas Brunner: yes for sur
[27/2/25, 17:38:00] Lucas Brunner: but it is below 1 so it means it is stationary
[27/2/25, 17:38:07] Lucas Brunner: or am I wrong ?
[27/2/25, 17:38:14] Luca Adjei MBD: no no ur right
‎[27/2/25, 17:38:39] Luca Adjei MBD: ‎image omitted
[27/2/25, 17:38:40] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: in theory yes but look at acf
[27/2/25, 17:39:26] Luca Adjei MBD: given the coefficient is high, it just decays more slowly
[27/2/25, 17:39:43] Lucas Brunner: yeah but the acf if it would not be fitted to AR1 would probably look different
[27/2/25, 17:40:06] Emin: yeah but also just looking at the AR model itself it looks pretty stationary
[27/2/25, 17:40:08] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: yeah its supposed to decay quickly, and he said it was after one or two lags max in the acf model
[27/2/25, 17:40:27] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: the trend is slightly increasing if u look closely
[27/2/25, 17:41:38] Emin: if you end up asking him let us know hahaha
[27/2/25, 17:41:54] Lucas Brunner: yes it is because it is fitted to AR1 I am pretty sure
[27/2/25, 17:41:54] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: i want to ask him now tbh
[27/2/25, 17:41:56] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: hahahahahaha
[27/2/25, 17:41:57] Lucas Brunner: now go ask him
[27/2/25, 17:42:23] Lucas Brunner: because prior to this it as probably tested that it is stationary and the ACF would look different
[27/2/25, 17:42:31] Lucas Brunner: but ask him

[2/3/25, 13:48:48] Lucas Brunner: yeah sure
[2/3/25, 13:48:52] Lucas Brunner: suck my dick fucker
[2/3/25, 13:50:18] Lucas Brunner: anybody heard of the unabomber?
[2/3/25, 13:50:51] Lucas Brunner: Vandad got the knowledge
[2/3/25, 14:00:45] Vandad Vafai: Ayo
[2/3/25, 22:30:45] Adam Kassab MBD: Where do we sign up tho? They’ll send us an email/form?
[2/3/25, 22:32:36] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: ^^
[2/3/25, 22:33:20] Emin: Classic PM giving no info on how this’ll work and then acting surprised/annoyed when we have questions about it
[2/3/25, 22:33:40] Emin: Assuming it’ll be a form and I don’t think it’s gonna be first come first serve cause that’ll be rwtarded
[2/3/25, 22:33:58] Vandad Vafai: That would actually be so ridiculous
[2/3/25, 22:34:00] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: It’s a form?
[2/3/25, 22:34:16] Vandad Vafai: Tf we gonna do sit down and refresh screen so we get the form faster
[2/3/25, 22:34:20] Emin: I would assume it’ll be a Google form, easiest way to aggregate all the info
[2/3/25, 22:34:54] Vandad Vafai: Yeah but if you don't make it you'll do a challenge like Mr Beast Games to compete for a seat
[2/3/25, 22:35:15] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: I’ll be up early to avoid bs
[2/3/25, 22:39:38] Emin: Quickly quickly!
[2/3/25, 22:40:05] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: Watch the form crash because over a hundred students are logging in
[3/3/25, 01:05:48] Robert Koegel: In the other masters its a bidding system. But would be fucked if they did that and don’t let us know
[3/3/25, 01:08:59] Emin: Do you know what they base the bidding off of?
[3/3/25, 01:09:12] Lucas Brunner: uff
[3/3/25, 01:09:30] Lucas Brunner: but would not be surprised if they did sth like this
[3/3/25, 01:31:35] Robert Koegel: Basically everyone has 1000 points and you bid a certain amount of points on subjects of your preference (eg 500 on your favourite). And then they will prefer the people who bid the most points to fill up the courses ‎<This message was edited>
[3/3/25, 01:32:03] Emin: Gotcha
[3/3/25, 01:33:55] Robert Koegel: I had the same thing in my bachelors and the way to go is like pick 2-3 subjects u really want and distribute the points equally. And then u bid 0 on a couple of other subjects. But I think u got a hang of which subjects might be popular so u have to bid a little more on these
[3/3/25, 01:34:41] Robert Koegel: I know the Business School Masters do it like this but don’t know about sci tec. Might be just a google form
[3/3/25, 01:36:25] Emin: “We kindly ask all of you to attend, as we will be explaining the list of electives, concentrations and the bidding process.”
[3/3/25, 01:36:31] Emin: Dumbfucks never talked about it which is awesome
[3/3/25, 01:37:08] Robert Koegel: Doing a bidding process and not explaining it is fucked if they really do it like this
[3/3/25, 01:38:06] Emin: Yeah they never cease to amaze me
[3/3/25, 08:51:00] Emin: How much are you guys dressing up for the career forum later

[3/3/25, 14:38:09] Sam: Ok fair
[3/3/25, 14:38:35] Sam: New strat for me is picking classes with non-Spanish professors to understand what’s being said

We had planned Marbella for beginning of March but since the water tank broke and the entire house was flooded (💀) we needed to fix shit (it is still getting fixed)

My proposal is that we should run Marbella twice in May, once on May 2nd to 4th or 5th (depending on classes) and once at the end of May as well (23rd or 30th)

Let me know if yo asses are ready for som heinous action down under🙏🏻🔥

[14/3/25, 11:23:57] Lucas Brunner: it is what we have done in last class
[14/3/25, 11:25:42] Isaac Chaljub: The Marketing Mix Model (MMM), also called Mixed Marketing Model, is a statistical analysis technique used to measure the impact of different marketing activities on sales and business outcomes. It helps businesses allocate their marketing budgets more effectively by understanding which channels (e.g., TV, digital ads, promotions) drive the most revenue.

How It Works
	1.	Data Collection: Historical data is gathered on sales, marketing spend (TV, digital, print, social media, etc.), economic factors, competitor actions, seasonality, and other external influences.
	2.	Statistical Modeling: Regression analysis (often multi-linear regression or more advanced machine learning methods) is used to quantify the impact of each marketing channel on sales.
	3.	Decomposition of Sales: The model breaks down sales into:
	•	Base Sales: Sales that would happen without marketing efforts.
	•	Incremental Sales: Sales generated by marketing activities.
	•	Seasonality Effects: Sales fluctuations due to seasonal trends.
	•	Other External Factors: Competitor actions, economic conditions, weather, etc.
	4.	Optimization & Simulation: Once the model is built, businesses can simulate scenarios (e.g., “What happens if I increase digital ad spend by 10%?”) and optimize budgets for maximum ROI.

Key Benefits
	•	Identifies high-ROI marketing channels.
	•	Helps in budget allocation to maximize sales.
	•	Accounts for external influences beyond marketing.
	•	Enables scenario planning to test different strategies.

Challenges
	•	Requires high-quality data over a long period.
	•	Doesn’t work well for new marketing channels with little historical data.
	•	May not capture real-time changes as it’s based on past data.
[14/3/25, 11:28:52] Isaac Chaljub: Basically a multi variable linear regression for simulation purposes

[14/3/25, 12:40:14] Emin: I think UNNEST() expands the nested data structures while FLATTEN() compacts them into a single row but I might be completely wrong
[14/3/25, 12:40:21] Emin: UNNEST for sure expands tho
[14/3/25, 12:40:45] Emin: or flatten() doesn’t exist lol
[14/3/25, 12:40:59] Emin: "As a possible workaround, the FLATTEN() function can be used in Google BigQuery to expand the nested fields into flat tables. Those tables, as saved views, can then be connected with Tableau Desktop.”

[15/3/25, 10:47:34] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: It is
[15/3/25, 10:47:35] Emin: Cause you don’t see which answers were correct and not

[15/3/25, 10:47:41] Emin: Oh
[15/3/25, 10:48:03] Felix: It’s only the MC

[15/3/25, 10:49:20] Felix: but out of 45
[15/3/25, 10:50:04] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: Yeah it was 39 questions at 1 point each and then the open ended 6 points
[15/3/25, 10:50:18] Felix: aah right
[15/3/25, 10:50:41] Emin: But my grade hasn’t changed since I submitted the exam and I don’t think he graded the open ended
[15/3/25, 10:51:03] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: Oh so you could see a grade already
[15/3/25, 10:51:07] Spencer Sveda Wood	MBD: Is anyone’s not graded?
[15/3/25, 10:51:13] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: Then why did I just receive an email

[15/3/25, 10:53:34] Vandad Vafai: You got a grade when you submitted the exam?
[15/3/25, 10:53:41] Emin: Right when I submitted it I got a 6/6 on the open ended which tells me he set it up wrong

[15/3/25, 10:56:17] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: Cause mine is out of 45
[15/3/25, 10:56:35] Emin: No it’s also out of 45
[15/3/25, 10:56:35] Vandad Vafai: Cause if not then you probably just received the grade for your project

[15/3/25, 11:01:43] Vandad Vafai: Could be the scenario that the mf is grading everything now and uploading shit manually
[15/3/25, 11:02:02] Vandad Vafai: Like he is the type of guy who would do that
[15/3/25, 11:02:36] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: maybe it’s graded automatically based on the mcq and then it counted the open ended one as 6/6
[15/3/25, 11:02:57] Felix: That wouldn’t mean all the best for me
[15/3/25, 11:03:08] Felix: why you say shit like that broski??

[15/3/25, 11:04:05] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: I’m just trying to understand, since Emin got his grade right after submitting
[15/3/25, 11:04:09] Vandad Vafai: Wait

predictor values.

[17/3/25, 01:07:30] Ayush Singh: I am confused here “Lemmatization is this text processing step where words with similar meaning are grouped”. He says True in his answer, but lemmatization reduces the word based on context, it doesnt group no ?

In KNN more work must be done at classification time than in training

[17/3/25, 11:07:05] Emin: Ok yeah cheers lads
[17/3/25, 11:07:19] Emin: Also wtf does this mean for KNN

Two neighbors are close if they belong to the same class
[17/3/25, 11:09:05] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: I think this is false because two neighbours can still be close if they’re in different classes
[17/3/25, 11:09:12] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: It’s a really vague statement
[17/3/25, 11:09:33] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: Brunner and I were tripping over that yest
[17/3/25, 11:09:34] Emin: Okay so he’s just tryna point out the fact that just cause two things are distance-wise close to each other doesn’t for sure mean they’re from the same class?
[17/3/25, 11:10:26] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: That’s my guess, knowing how he does things
[17/3/25, 11:10:52] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: This just looks like a prime alvaro trap
[17/3/25, 11:12:00] Isaac Chaljub: Exactly
[17/3/25, 11:12:47] Emin: Little whore he is
[17/3/25, 11:23:25] Lucas Brunner: is it not that it needs more time in prediction?
[17/3/25, 11:25:11] Lucas Brunner: or classification he means predicting?
[17/3/25, 11:25:12] Lucas Brunner: then it is correct actually
[17/3/25, 11:25:12] Lucas Brunner: haha
[17/3/25, 11:25:15] Emin: It’s quick during the training because it’s a “lazy” algorithm but ends up taking longer during classification/prediction
[17/3/25, 11:25:23] Lucas Brunner: yes
[17/3/25, 11:25:24] Lucas Brunner: exactly
[17/3/25, 11:25:35] Ayush Singh: Also it might be that two neighbors might not be close if they belong to the same class
[17/3/25, 11:25:49] Emin: true true
[17/3/25, 11:25:58] Lucas Brunner: he made this example in class

[17/3/25, 12:48:42] Robert Koegel: Emin vs alvaro in quizes is the best rivalry i have seen in years
[17/3/25, 12:49:02] Vandad Vafai: I am sorry
[17/3/25, 12:49:15] Emin: Bro i asked him is it something we do during naive bayes or is it a result and he said “i mean during”
[17/3/25, 12:49:21] Emin: so i said true because it’s something we do during NB
[17/3/25, 12:49:37] Emin: really not much else to it, he just didn’t understand what I said

[17/3/25, 12:54:43] Luca Adjei MBD: dont think so
[17/3/25, 12:55:07] Luca Adjei MBD: I just assumed he meant lower variance but its so cunty
[17/3/25, 12:56:27] Vandad Vafai: yea, he said with low variance / higher bias, predictions are more stable

[17/3/25, 12:59:17] Vandad Vafai: Yeahhhh uhh scuse me
[17/3/25, 13:01:37] Louis-Esmel Kodo MBD: I think optimal trade off is to have both « stability » and accuracy, while he asked only about the stability part in his question

[18/3/25, 00:34:44] Lucas Brunner: u get me
[18/3/25, 00:34:46] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: he said that getting errors in the test script wouldnt be an issue if our main script runs properly right?
[18/3/25, 00:34:47] Emin: It’s good practice but not long at all
[18/3/25, 00:35:09] Vandad Vafai: Did he?
[18/3/25, 00:35:14] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: i think so
[18/3/25, 00:35:18] Emin: Honestly have no clue
[18/3/25, 00:36:19] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: but when he says the exam submission will be format, im assuming he'll want

[18/3/25, 10:22:00] Emin: You and your spouse trying to both find an academic position
[18/3/25, 10:22:23] Emin: The connection is shite, lowkey a waste of time

[18/3/25, 10:48:48] Sam: The rambling is crazy
[18/3/25, 10:49:25] Isaac Chaljub: This hits too close to home
[18/3/25, 10:49:36] Isaac Chaljub: Imma go lay in a ditch
[18/3/25, 10:50:02] Emin: I mean if you wanna get a job and then go get a PhD and you’re 32 or whatever Richi is, it’s gonna be tough
[18/3/25, 10:50:13] Emin: You’re a young grandpa, don’t worry Saac 😘
[18/3/25, 10:51:02] Vandad Vafai: Throwback Richi shutting down Isaac's aspirations on growing up and being like him

[18/3/25, 10:57:00] Vandad Vafai: Drop
[18/3/25, 10:57:04] Isaac Chaljub: MLOps is not that technical
[18/3/25, 10:57:17] Isaac Chaljub: deep learning would be better
[18/3/25, 10:57:18] Isaac Chaljub: IMO
[18/3/25, 10:57:34] Vandad Vafai: MLOPS way more practical than deep learning
[18/3/25, 10:57:38] Luca Adjei MBD: haven’t really looked at the syllabi for either so no clue
[18/3/25, 10:57:48] Luca Adjei MBD: will take a look on campus

[18/3/25, 11:57:42] Luca Adjei MBD: Read some economist articles
[18/3/25, 11:58:03] Luca Adjei MBD: Was nice
[18/3/25, 12:00:29] Emin: Anyone know what alvaro means in these questions? Can’t remember if high-quality is just a trick or something we talked about and the wording of the second one is really confusing

- “3 factors” is a high-quality solution (DR mock)
- The way to aggregate in bagging is to calculate the average value of variables of the samples extracted
[18/3/25, 12:01:06] Alejandro Perez: CEO Luca
[18/3/25, 12:32:18] Isaac Chaljub: High quality in DR is having eigenvalues that are much higher than 1
[18/3/25, 12:32:46] Isaac Chaljub: In bagging the average is of the statistic or metric or value as far as I know
[18/3/25, 12:32:53] Isaac Chaljub: Not the variables but I could be mistaken
[18/3/25, 12:33:40] Lucas Brunner: we talked about high quality in every class 🤪🤪🤪

[18/3/25, 13:06:52] Vandad Vafai: Yeah bro
[18/3/25, 13:07:09] Vandad Vafai: Depending on how long you present you do a Q&A after
[18/3/25, 13:07:15] Luca Adjei MBD: I know a lot of groups will all be presenting tbh
[18/3/25, 13:07:33] Vandad Vafai: Our group will most likely be Adam, Joy Z destroyer and me

[19/3/25, 13:20:07] Felix: Autistic little shit
[19/3/25, 14:49:14] Alejandro Perez: 1. Regular Expressions
Email Validation

Write a function validate_email(email_str: str) -> bool that returns True if email_str follows a simple pattern of characters, an @, and a domain (e.g., somebody@example.com), and False otherwise.
Apply this function to the customer_email column to see which rows have invalid emails.
Phone Number Standardization

Observe that phone_number has many formats:
555-123-4567, (555) 987-6543, 555.456.7890, +1 (555) 765-4321, 555=333=4444, etc.
Write a regex to extract only the digits and possibly a leading “+1” if present.
Create a new column, e.g. phone_standardized, that stores the phone number as just digits or in a consistent XXX-XXX-XXXX format.
Product ID Checks

Some product_id entries might be empty ("") or contain special characters. Use a regex to find which product_id entries do not match your criteria (for example, alphanumeric with optional hyphens).
Flag the invalid product IDs in a new boolean column named invalid_product_id.
2. Unit Tests
Test Your Regex Functions

Using Python’s built-in unittest or pytest, write test cases for:
validate_email: Provide examples of valid and invalid emails, assert the function behaves as expected.
standardize_phone: Provide phone numbers in different formats, check if the output matches the expected standardized string.
Test Data Type Conversions

Some rows in the amount column are “invalid”. Write a function safe_to_float(value) that attempts to convert a string to a float and returns None or raises a specific exception if it fails.
Write unit tests to confirm the function behaves correctly with both valid amounts (e.g., "19.99", "75.50") and invalid ones ("invalid", "").
Test Your Parsing Logic

If you create a custom function to parse order_date with multiple date formats, write unit tests for each date format you expect (e.g., "2025-03-18 14:23:00", "03/18/2025", "20250320", etc.).
Confirm that invalid or empty strings return None or raise a known exception.
3. Error Handling
Converting amount

Attempt to convert the amount column to floats using pd.to_numeric.
python
Copy
Edit
df["amount"] = pd.to_numeric(df["amount"], errors="coerce")
Observe what happens to the rows with “invalid”.
Show how you might handle or log these rows, for instance by creating a separate DataFrame of failed rows or setting them to NaN and dropping them.
Data Wrangling with Try/Except

Write a loop (or function) that iterates over each row and tries to parse its phone_number and amount.
If a parsing error happens, catch it with try/except and print (or log) the row index plus an error message.
Handling Rows with Multiple Errors

Some rows might have both an invalid amount and an invalid order_date. Show how you could:
Attempt to parse both in a single try/except block.
Record the specific errors in a custom dictionary or log for that row.
4. Datetime Parsing and Transformation
Multiple Date Formats

The order_date column has multiple formats:
2025-03-18 14:23:00, 03/18/2025, 18-03-2025 09:00, 20250320, Mar 20, 2025, 2025-03-20T08:30:00, etc.
Use pd.to_datetime(df["order_date"], infer_datetime_format=True, errors="coerce") and check which rows fail.
Alternatively, try writing a custom function that attempts a series of datetime.strptime patterns until one succeeds.
Extracting Time Components

After successfully parsing the order_date into a pandas datetime, create new columns:
year, month, day, and perhaps hour.
Convert them to integers so you can easily filter or group by them.
Filtering and Grouping by Date

Filter the rows to those in March 2025 (i.e., 2025-03-01 through 2025-03-31).
Group by region and calculate the total or average amount for that month.
Show how many rows come from each distinct date format (optional advanced step if you track which parser succeeded).
5. Putting It All Together
Complete “Data Cleaning” Pipeline

Write a script or function that:
Reads in the CSV (with sep=';').
Attempts to parse and standardize phone_number, order_date, amount, and product_id.
Flags or filters out invalid emails.
Logs any rows with critical failures (e.g., can’t parse the date or amount) to a separate CSV or DataFrame.
Returns a cleaned DataFrame ready for further analysis.
Final Validation Step

Write a few unit tests or checks that ensure, after cleaning:
No NaN values remain in region and order_date columns (unless intentionally allowed).
All amount values are numeric.
All phone numbers match your chosen standardized format.
Basic Analysis

Once your data is clean, do a quick analysis:
df.describe() on the numeric columns (e.g., amount).
Count how many unique product_ids exist.
Print out the top 3 regions by total sales (sum of amount).
Plot or summarize the distribution of order dates.

[20/3/25, 11:50:44] Emin: Anyone remembers for ML which tree or boosting method can act as cross validation by itself?
[20/3/25, 11:51:05] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: XGBoost maybe?
[20/3/25, 11:51:10] Luca Adjei MBD: random forest pretty sure
[20/3/25, 11:51:12] Youssef Hakim Abdel Nasser MBD: Cause its an ensemble method
[20/3/25, 11:51:14] Felix: Random for
[20/3/25, 11:51:36] Emin: Okay and bagging can too, just found in my notes
[20/3/25, 11:51:37] Emin: Thanks fellers
[20/3/25, 11:55:05] Lucas Brunner: so RF Bagging and Xgboost
[20/3/25, 11:55:06] Lucas Brunner: ?
[20/3/25, 11:55:33] Emin: idk about xgboost but for sure bagging and random forest
[20/3/25, 11:55:42] Emin: Cause xgboost doesn’t split up the data like bagging/rf do
[20/3/25, 11:56:09] Lucas Brunner: but it changes weight for the misclassified ones
[20/3/25, 11:56:18] Lucas Brunner: okok
[20/3/25, 11:56:26] Vandad Vafai: We don’t have backtracking in ML as usual no
[20/3/25, 11:58:42] Luca Adjei MBD: we only had it for last final pretty sure
[20/3/25, 11:59:02] Lucas Brunner: but wait for bagging you use the OOB fro crossvalidation and in the RF how do you ddo that?
[20/3/25, 11:59:15] Vandad Vafai: So we did have it
[20/3/25, 11:59:21] Felix: Bro is sooo worried
[20/3/25, 11:59:28] Lucas Brunner: haha
[20/3/25, 11:59:31] Vandad Vafai: Lucas take a xany
[20/3/25, 11:59:31] Emin: So I honestly didn’t know how to explain cross validation until i just searched it up but it’s the act of splitting up the data into multiple subsets
[20/3/25, 11:59:31] Lucas Brunner: no I want to understand

[20/3/25, 11:59:47] Lucas Brunner: bootstrapping
[20/3/25, 11:59:51] Emin: exactly
[20/3/25, 11:59:58] Emin: that’s why bagging and RF are CV methods by themselves
[20/3/25, 12:00:18] Lucas Brunner: ahh ok
[20/3/25, 12:00:54] Lucas Brunner: ahh got it now
[20/3/25, 12:01:26] Lucas Brunner: bagging just does not take all variables 
while RF takes all variables when performing bootstrapping so you can get for both the OOB score
[20/3/25, 12:02:03] Emin: other way around, bagging uses all variables and RF uses a subset
[20/3/25, 12:02:09] Lucas Brunner: yeah fuck sry
[20/3/25, 12:02:24] Emin: but yeah that’s it

Dear NQB,

The NQB planning team would like to invite you the term 2 send off to LUH-GASCA 138 for a special (JM🥰) event!!!!

We will kick the night off at 10pm at Lagasca 138 and the NQB Fortnite event will happen on 10:30pm SPOT ON. Unfortunately, if you're late, you'll miss out a BIG NQB lore.😰

Afterwards, we plan to travel to VICTORIA which we will be having Luh FAGS and Luh FAG-HAGS with us there and we will get out of control.🤪

The event team hopes to see you all tomorrow at the stage. I'd say even if you don't want to go out afterwards, just show up for the BIG event.

Kindest regards,
The Event Team🍆

[21/3/25, 11:45:07] Sam: 🚨 Career Lesson: Beware of Distractions 🚨

As I sit in class, I can’t help but notice the group of people on the right side of the room, engaging in their endless chatter. While they may think they’re just socializing, they’re missing out on something much more important: focus. 📉

What have I learned from these right-side talkers? Well, let’s dive in:

1️⃣ Distraction Kills Progress – Constantly talking and disrupting the flow of the class is the perfect example of how distractions hold us back. In a career, this behavior leads to wasted time, missed opportunities, and a lack of real growth. ⏳

2️⃣ Prioritize the Big Picture – It’s easy to get caught up in the noise and sideline conversations, but real success comes when you know when to tune out the distractions and focus on the bigger picture. 🧠

3️⃣ The Importance of Professionalism – In the workplace, professionalism is EVERYTHING. If you’re the one constantly talking during meetings or not paying attention, you’ll quickly become known for all the wrong reasons. 🚫

So here’s a friendly reminder: The ability to stay quiet, focused, and engaged is a skill that will serve you in your career. Distractions won’t get you ahead. 🚶‍♂️

[24/3/25, 21:24:49] Alejandro Perez: going w @491627068848 and @32470828602
[24/3/25, 21:24:52] Alejandro Perez: im there at 10pm
[24/3/25, 21:24:56] Alejandro Perez: if u want pu to mine and we can ubs
[25/3/25, 10:35:29] Emin: any of you deployed to streamlit cloud?
[25/3/25, 10:36:39] Isaac Chaljub: Sam and I
[25/3/25, 10:36:57] Emin: Bro everything is working but I think it’s rate limiting my api calls since it’s live – how do I fix that
[25/3/25, 10:37:11] Isaac Chaljub: What do you mean?
[25/3/25, 10:37:24] Isaac Chaljub: I never had any issues, but I don’t know how you built the calls
[25/3/25, 10:37:33] Isaac Chaljub: Like the Simfin api?
[25/3/25, 10:38:31] Emin: Yeah the simfin api
[25/3/25, 10:39:22] Isaac Chaljub: It’s weird cause I only call it once perp refresh, but you can use a sleeper in the function to avoid going over the limit
[25/3/25, 10:39:37] Isaac Chaljub: Daniel specified the limit between calls
[25/3/25, 10:39:47] Emin: hmm okay let me see
[25/3/25, 10:41:27] Sam: Is it working slower? That’s happening to me too on cloud but not locally
[25/3/25, 10:42:14] Emin: No it’s giving me errors when trying to call it but not when I run it locally
[25/3/25, 10:42:34] Sam: What type of error?
[25/3/25, 10:43:35] Emin: Some sort of JSON decode error, I’m trying to see the actual API reponse it’s giving me now to see what the root cause is
[25/3/25, 10:43:41] Isaac Chaljub: Oh yeah it’s waaaay slower
[25/3/25, 10:43:50] Isaac Chaljub: Could be it’s down
[25/3/25, 10:44:18] Emin: nah but if it works locally then it’s probably an issue with how I implemented the calls for the cloud
[25/3/25, 10:45:18] Sam: Yeah like tbh barely even usable for the demo, if i call 3-4 stocks it just goes crazily slow
[25/3/25, 10:45:32] Sam: Might use local version for demo if I can’t speed it up
[25/3/25, 10:46:00] Isaac Chaljub: I went super basic and only call one stock at a a time
[25/3/25, 10:46:05] Isaac Chaljub: And even then it’s slow af

[24/4/25, 13:05:01] Sam: Berkeley, Vancouver, Madrid, Marbella — the path of a prodigy. Crowned now in the arena of ranked jerkmate, where reflex meets reverence. Vandad Vafai — not merely a player, but a phenomenon. A name etched into the meta, sculpted in split-seconds and silence. No emotes, no excess — just elegance. From the wide-eyed wonder of his Berkeley beginnings to the unshakable composure of Marbella mastery, he returns not as a contender, but as a cornerstone. Vintage Vandad. Beyond rank, beyond replica. Reunited with greatness.

[29/4/25, 21:44:52] Vandad Vafai: It's the fan themselves to blame cause they can give it to other fans to buy from websites but they place it on Viagogo so a mf like me could pay more than John, 54, Liverpool with a salary of £24k per year😂
[29/4/25, 21:59:33] Vandad Vafai: Buenas nachos amigos💀🔥🥀
For celebrating unc losing his virginity I say we hit Marbella from 30th May - 2nd June and drop some new lore🙏🏻
Please let me know if you can make it and I want us to book tickets asap so we don't have to deal with bullshit train prices. 
Leave a POSITIVE reaction under this if you are 100% down. If you are gonna let me know later it is ok but it's better for you to book earlier for the train prices... and if you can't make it let the chat know you're gay🥀
Thank you NQB🎷
